### Project 1: Google Play Store Reviews
*Description:* From the Google Play store Dataset, I have decided to perform visualization on 3 dependent columns(Ratings, Prices and Reviews) mainly for our data visualization. I have performed Data Cleaning to remove the outliers and null values using mean, mode and median aggregate functions.
Then changed the data types to the respective columns to perform an aggregate function to the presented null values in columns. Then finally, I have created the 3 data visualization graph with bubbles and lines for a better understanding of which one has low and high points.
